## Introduction

Dynamic reports are data-driven documents that can be periodically updated as their underlying data changes.

This training provides a brief introduction to writing dynamic reports using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and [Posit Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) (previously known as RStudio Cloud). It runs as a series of four interactive sessions, and is designed for those without previous programming experience working in health, care, and housing across Scotland. It is intended as a starting point for automating your report writing processes, with the aim of replacing, enhancing, or simplifying, manual report writing. The training also covers ways of producing reports in a variety of formats including .pdf, .docx (Word format), and .html (webpage).

Some examples of routine reports that might be targets for re-working in a dynamic format:

- service-use reports (admission figures, bed utilisation)
- annual reports (public health annual reports)
- engagement and impact data (training, outreach)

### Who is this training for?
This training is intended for someone who:

+ is currently spending lots of time manually updating reports in health, care, or housing
+ **and** would like to reduce the time spent on this routine work over the medium-term (months)
+ **and** has some time to spend reworking this report-writing process 
+ **and** are open to gaining some basic programming experience

### What this training is not

+ it's not a full introduction to working in [R](https://www.r-project.org/)/[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is deep (like most analytic platforms), and this training covers only a little bit of the available functionality
+ it's not an introduction to everything that you might like to do with a data-driven report either. Instead, it covers some simple examples of common tasks as a way of familiarising you with a different workflow
+ it's definitely not a production-ready replacement for your existing reports. It's a learning resource, rather than a pre-packed replacement
+ it won't teach you how to make real-time dashboards. If you need your report to update more than about once a day, you should consider building a dashboard instead ([Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-gb/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/)/[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), or [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/))

## About dynamic reports

### Is it worth it for me?

```{r out.width="500px", echo=F}

```

A recent personal example of a copy and paste error encountered while writing a short report. This would have been avoided with a dynamic report.

Ultimately, it's for you to decide whether automating your report will be worth the investment of time. But to help you come to a decision, here are some of the strengths and weaknesses of dynamic reports compared to traditionally-produced static reports:

#### Strengths

+ **fidelity**. A dynamic report means no manual updating of text, graphs, and figures. No more copy and paste problems (see the Teams chat message above).
+ **standardisation**. If you have lots of similar reports to write, this dynamic approach simplifies the process of making your reports look alike by applying a standard approach to formatting, analysis, and so on. This is a huge time-saver, and is especially true if you have lots of graphs and tables to produce.
+ **reproducibility**. If someone else looks at the source code for your report, they can see exactly how your figures are produced. That means that, when it's time to hand over production of your report to a colleague, you won't need to explain how to build the report. It's all contained in the source-code.
+ **efficiency**. Again assuming that everything works properly, updating a dynamic report with new data should be much quicker than updating a comparable report by hand.

#### Weaknesses

+ **set-up cost**. Particularly if you are new to this kind of work, writing a new dynamic report takes much longer than a traditional report. There's plenty to learn, and it can be hard to find the time to learn, and to rework an established process.
+ **errors**. While dynamic reports are a great way of avoiding minor errors from copying and pasting, they can introduce entirely new sources of error from reworking your analysis. Reports, particularly early on, need frequent careful checking to ensure that you haven't swapped small frequent errors for large, subtle ones.
+ **Information Governance and data protection concerns** about the platforms used to write these kinds of reports. 
+ **novelty**. Changing processes is often controversial, with a degree of resistance. For example, there's a strong lock-in to the Microsoft Office suite (Word and Excel especially) for report writing. Suggesting something new can be daunting. Change management and QI methods might be helpful if you think this is likely to be a substantial concern for your project.

On balance dynamic reports have more advantages than disadvantages. But decisions about whether to automate a report will depend on the local factors in play. It might be useful to have a think about how dynamic report writing might fit into your work before the training session too - and discuss them with your colleagues.

## Getting started

### How does it work

We'll use three tools to write the report. First, we'll use the web service [Posit Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). This allows us to run [R](https://www.r-project.org/) without installing any software or making any changes to our computer. Next, we'll use the markup language [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to add some text and images to our report. Finally, we'll use the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language to do some simple data handling, analysis, and visualisation.

Just in case you'd like to look into how these tools work in advance of the session, we would recommend:

+ a quick [introduction to Posit (RStudio) Cloud from R bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/02/rstudio-cloud-how-to-get-started-for-free/)
+ [Rstudio's quick tour of Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html) is a great place to start if R and RMarkdown is completely new to you
+ If you're already somewhat familiar with working in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), you might prefer to start with the [Rmarkdown chapter in the *R for Data Science* book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html)

[Posit Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) is easy to set-up and free for small-scale work like this demo. This makes it by far the easiest way to get going from scratch if you've never worked with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) before. Note that because it's a web service, it requires you to upload your data to their servers, which might makes it unsuitable for production work in health and care owing to information governance concerns. That said, it's easy to transfer projects from [Posit Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) to an installed version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/), so don't worry that what you learn here will be tied to the cloud forever. 

One important tip: this is a learning resource, and you'll need time to think about it, play around with it, and reflect on how it might inform your work. Don't try to use this training to change your way of writing reports under pressure. There's quite a lot to think about here, and you might need to spend a good bit of time working out how to adapt this demonstration to fit your report. Think of this as the start of a journey, rather than a destination.


### What you'll need

As Posit Cloud is a web service, you don't need a particularly up-to-date computer to completed this training. As long as you have a reliable internet connection, and are capable of making a video call with Microsoft Teams (for the face-to-face part of the training), then you should be fine. The demonstration has been tested on Windows 10, Windows 11, and Ubuntu Linux 21.04 without platform-specific difficulties.

It is extremely helpful, although not essential, to have a multi-monitor setup. That way you can run the demonstration in one screen, and the Teams call on the other.

### Joining instructions

You'll need to do a little bit of preparation before the first training session, which should take about 15 minutes to complete. Please make sure you have completed this before the start of the first session so that we can make a prompt start. If you're new to [Posit Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud), please follow the step-by-step instructions below. If you've worked with Posit Cloud before, you can just sign-in to your account at [Posit Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), create a new project from the [GitHub Repository at https://github.com/bclarke-nes/Introductory-R-and-Rmarkdown](https://github.com/bclarke-nes/Introductory-R-and-Rmarkdown), and then open the `demo.Rmd` file from the file pane.

#### Step-by-step instructions

1. Go to [https://rstudio.cloud/](https://rstudio.cloud/) to access Posit Cloud

2. If you have an account, you can log in as normal. Otherwise, please create a new account by selecting `Get started for free`, following the steps, and then signing-in

```{r out.width="200px", fig.align='center', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rsc_create.png")
```

Several users have reported difficulties completing this account creation process. A quick workaround is to create the account from your phone (or other non-NHS device). You can then log-in using your new credentials from your NHS computer.

3. Once you've signed-in to Posit Cloud, add a new project by clicking ```New Project >> New Project from a Git repository```. 

When prompted, enter the URL `https://github.com/bclarke-nes/Introductory-R-and-Rmarkdown`

If you've never used GitHub before, you can think of it as a website where programmers can store code. All we're doing in this step is creating a copy of the training files in your Posit Cloud account. If you'd like to learn more about GitHub, we recommend [this brief and non-technical introduction](https://unito.io/blog/guide-to-github-for-project-managers/).

```{r out.width="200px", fig.align='center',echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/proj.png")
```

4. That will give you a new project containing the files needed for this demonstration: 

```{r out.width="500px", fig.align='center',echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/screen.png")
```

Don't worry if this first sight of the the [Posit Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) interface is a shock. There's an awful lot happening here, and most of the apparent complexity is just information overload! We'll start adapting the interface to be more friendly at the start of the first interactive session.

5. Open the `session_01_introduction.Rmd` file from the Files pane in the bottom right-hand corner by clicking on its name

```{r out.width="400px", fig.align='center',echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/load.png")
```

That's it - you're ready for the first session.
